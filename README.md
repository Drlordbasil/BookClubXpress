# Virtual Book Club Organizer

This Python project aims to create a virtual book club organizer that allows users to easily manage and participate in book clubs online. The program provides features such as book recommendation, user account creation, book search and details, book club creation, book club discussions, voting mechanism for book selection, virtual meeting integration, reading progress tracking, and notifications and reminders.

## Key Features

### 1. Book Recommendation Engine

The program utilizes web scraping with BeautifulSoup to extract book information from popular book recommendation websites. This includes details like title, author, genre, and user ratings. To provide personalized recommendations, a machine learning algorithm is implemented, considering the user's reading preferences and past book ratings.

### 2. User Account Creation

Users can create individual accounts using a user-friendly interface. User data is stored securely in a database (e.g., SQLite or MongoDB) hosted on a cloud server.

### 3. Book Search & Details

The program implements a search feature using the Google Books API, enabling users to search for books by title, author, or genre. Relevant book details, including a plot summary, book cover image, and average ratings, are displayed.

### 4. Book Club Creation

Users can create their own book clubs and invite friends to join. Each book club is assigned a unique ID for easy identification and management.

### 5. Book Club Discussions

To facilitate book club discussions, the program includes a messaging system within the application. Users can post comments, questions, and responses related to the selected book. Real-time updates notify users of new discussions and responses.

### 6. Voting Mechanism

The program incorporates a voting system for book club members to suggest and vote on the next book to read. Data analysis techniques are employed to analyze voting patterns and provide genre or author suggestions for future book selections.

### 7. Virtual Meeting Integration

Integration with popular video conferencing platforms such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams allows users to easily schedule and manage virtual book club meetings. Scheduling functionality is provided within the application for convenient coordination.

### 8. Reading Progress Tracking

Users can track their reading progress for each book, mark favorite parts, and leave digital bookmarks. The program displays progress metrics, such as the percentage completed, and generates personalized reading insights.

### 9. Notifications and Reminders

To keep users informed, the program implements a notification system that sends reminders about upcoming book club meetings, voting deadlines, and new book recommendations.

### 10. Data Backup and Recovery

User data is regularly backed up to a cloud storage service, such as Google Drive or Amazon S3. This ensures data security and provides a recovery option in case of accidental deletions or system failures.
